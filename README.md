# Bank Churn Prediction ðŸ’µðŸ’µ

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn prediction using machine learning models. The project aims to identify key factors influencing customer attrition and to develop predictive models that can help mitigate churn rates in a financial services context.

### Goal:
Develop a predictive model to identify at-risk customers. Uncover patterns in customer behavior and demographics. Inform targeted retention strategies. Enhance customer engagement and reduce churn rates.

### Objective:
To analyze customer data to predict churn rates and identify factors leading to attrition.

## Project Highlights

**Data Exploration and Visualization:** Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer demographics, transaction behaviors, and interaction patterns.

**Feature Engineering:** Identified and engineered relevant features, including transaction amounts, customer relationships, and interaction frequency.

**Modeling:** Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict customer churn.

**Feature Importance Analysis:** Utilized feature importance metrics to highlight significant predictors of churn, leading to actionable insights for business strategies.

## Key Findings

- The Total Nominal Transaction in the Last 12 Months is the most significant predictor of churn, suggesting a direct correlation between transaction behavior and customer retention.
- The Number of Products Used by Customers also plays a vital role in predicting churn, indicating that fostering strong customer relationships can enhance retention efforts.
- Insights from Increase in Customer Transaction Nominal Between Q4 and Q1 and Total Funds Used in One Period indicate that managing customer balances and spending patterns can significantly affect churn likelihood.
- The analysis of customer demographics and interaction frequency reveals opportunities for targeted marketing and personalized engagement strategies to improve customer loyalty.

## Recommendations

- Implement strategies to increase customer engagement, especially for those with lower transaction amounts.
- Focus on enhancing customer service and relationship management practices to build stronger connections with customers.
- Utilize the predictive model to identify at-risk customers proactively and apply retention tactics tailored to their behaviors.
